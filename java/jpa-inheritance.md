# [Java Persistence/Inheritance](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Inheritance#Mapped_Superclasses)

There are 4 ways to implement java inheritance on JPA persistence, basically by using annotaions.

First of all, Through `@Inheritance` you can use three inheritance strategies defined from the `InhertanceType` enum, `SINGLE_TABLE`, `TABLE_PER_CLASS` and `JOINED`.

JPA also support mapped superclass concept by using `@MappedSuperclass`.

## Single Table Inheritance

## Joined, Multiple Table Inheritance

## Table Per Class Inheritance

## Mapped Superclasses
